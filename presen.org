* Classical Planning 

_/✔/_ *Scalable, Highly-optimized solver* for complex combinatorial problems

_/✔/_ Guided by *domain-independent* heuristics

*/✘/* *Requires an explicit encoding* of the real world, written by human

* Reinforcement Learning

Policy function \pi(s): S \rightarrow A --- returns action a for state s

Optimal Policy \pi^*(s)

Goal: Find the best approximation of $\pi^*$

* Reinforcement Learning in Latent Space

* Deep Reinforcement Learning


* Comparison
